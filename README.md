### Motivation for Unit

This topic fills the need to have units that extend the curriculum for differentiation purposes.  It is important for students to be exposed to libraries and the possibility of quickly using code to dramatically enhance a website. Learning to use containers, divs, advanced CSS, allows greater access to more powerful features of front end web development.  Javascript is the language used by the Bootstrap platform and very important for students to be exposed to in an intro Web Development course.  The motivation is exposure, skill development, and fun!
